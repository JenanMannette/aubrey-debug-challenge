    	<h1>Goals</h1>
        <p>My biggest career/life goal is to solve problems to make peoples lives better and easier.  I've tried to do this countless ways by first studying to be a chemical engineer, studying to become a psychologist, and finally choosing to become an art director for an advertising/branding agency. I've found that changing the world for the better is a terribly slow process as a junior creative who's biggest responsibility at the office is to change a font from Calibri to Arial.</p>
        
        <p>I can't wait to start gSchool and to have the ability to solve huge problems using the tools I will learn.  The main problem I would like help solve with said abilities through the infinite reach of le Internet is the nutrition problem of the US and other countries. Another problem I would love to help with is the gender equality gap.  Besides these long-term goals, after gSchool, I would love to work for an agency like Quick Left or a company like BuzzFeed.</p>
